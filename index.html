        A jayhawk is a fictional bird based on non-fictional occurences. 
        <br>
        Jayhawkers were Kansan's during the civil war who would go to missouri and steal back slaves for their freedom. 
        <br>
        This resulted in much blood shed and the eventual burning down of the city of Lawrence. 
         <br>
        The Jayhawk has been the mascot for the University of Kansas since around 1886.
